GistMaker
=========

A simple OS X utility to create Gists with a few key commands!

=========
Usage: When the app launches, open your preferences to login and stuff.
Set your key command... I think it defaults to cmd+option+shift+g
Enjoy!

But why is it so ugly?
Because I'm not a designer... if you are, feel free to make beautiful icons, windows, and buttons! :)

It's missing feature XYZ...
Sorry, I built this for myself, but feel free to submit pull requests!
